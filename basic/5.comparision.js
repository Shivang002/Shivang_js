// the comparision operation in  javascript works same as normal and return boolean result
//the  comparision operator : >=,<=,>,<
// in javascript the comparision operator and equality checker works different 
//equality checker -> ==,===
// example
console.log(null >0); // this return false becuase the js consider here null as 0 soo 0 can't > 0
console.log(null ==0);// here the equality  checker comes into play for null as it works differently foor null 
console.log(null >= 0); // this results in true becoz 0=0 so it's true
 // here === is called as "Strict Check " becoz  it checks  the value  as well the datatype
 //Eg:
 console.log("02"== 2);  // this will give true
 console.log("99" === 99); // this will give false
